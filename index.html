I first learned my passion for cybersecurity when I myself was scammed when I was younger. I currently major in cybersecurity and have an associates. I'm currently attending an internship at a biotech company. My life has always been around technology so I am always interested in learning more about it.</p>

        <h3>Personal projects</h3>
        <h4>Illustrating</h4>
        <p>One passion I have is being an illustrator for 2 authors. My friend Andy Branham who has released 2 books on amazon and my mother who sells children's coloring books for Navajo children. I have always loved drawing and most things in these illustrations are something I am passionate about.</p>
        <h3>Professional Projects</h3>
        <h4>Internship</h4>
        <p>Currently I'm interning at a biotech company, the experience and a place to test and further my knowledge is much needed to progress in my field. Although no notable things have been achieved yet, I am hopeful that this internship can turn into something more as I would love to have a job at this company.</p>
